# Overview

The purpose of this exercise was to create a webpage for UFOlogists to search sightings by date, city, state, country and shape. This would provide those researchers the ability to perform in-depth analysis of UFO sightings using muliple criteria simultaneously.

# Results

When a researcher initially visits the webpage, the page displays the entire database of UFO sightings in the table.

The power of the filtering available on the page shows as the user enters criteria into the search fields. For instance, visitors can search the database by date:

They can filter the data by city:

They can filter the data by state:

They can filter the data by country:

And, finally, they can filter the data by the shape of the UFO:

# Summary
While the page is attractive and the search functions work as intended, however there is an opportunity to significantly improve the user experience by upgrading the search functionality. Specifically, there are two ways this could be improved.

1. Recommendation 1: Force users to enter by mm/dd/yyyy

2. Recommendation 2: Use dropdown menus instead of text boxes for the other search boxes.
